This project shows a basic personal webpage as requested in Assignment A1. It includes brief info of me: my background, my interests, my experiences, and the CS courses I have taken at WPI (Also some animation and styling work for the achievements). I used Github to host and vrsion control this small project/assignment.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: For header, footer, body, lists, and section headers.
- **Created simple animation with JavaScript**: Fades the main heading when the page loads.
- **Used HMTL Tags**: Including "<header>", "<section>", "<footer>", "<a>" for links, and "<img>" for images.

## Design Achievements
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
- **Created and used a 5 color Adobe color palette**:
    - "#dbdad4" for Body Background
    - "#181817" for Base Txt && Footer
    - "#e12c15" for Main Header
    - "#e04912" for Section Headers
    - "#dbc624" for List Background
- **Uploaded my color palette**: To the repo as "color-palette.png"
