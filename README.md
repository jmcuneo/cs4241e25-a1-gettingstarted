This project shows a combination of HTML, CSS styling, and JavaScript to create a simple website that serves as a self-introduction for CS 4241. HTML was used to format and add the contents of the website. CSS was used to style the website and individual elements of the HTML. JavaScript was used to make the interactive portion of the website. There is a server file, which is JavaScript, to allow local hosting of the website. This project allowed me to experiment with the different aspects of creating a website.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body, section, h1, img, hr, and footer tags
    - body: I wanted the contents of the website to have some distance from the edge of the browser, so I added padding. I decided to use padding instead of margins because I wanted the contents inside the body to be shifted, not the element itself. I also specified the font I wanted for the whole body of the website.
    - section: I divided the top portion of the website into a separate class called  "intro" as my introduction paragraph. I only wanted the text in this section to be italicized, so I added that as a rule to the styling of the "intro". I also added a "textblocks" section so that the lists would be inline with each other.
    - h1: I wanted to center the title, so I text-aligned it in the center.
    - img: I wanted to scale the image, so I changed the width of the image and scaled the height. I also added a solid border to the image to make it stand out.
    - hr: I added a line between the top and bottom portion of the website and I made the weight of the line thicker by creating a border and widening th top portion. I added padding at the bottom to put some space between the line and the bottom section.
    - footer: I added a footer at the bottom of the website with a link to a game I like playing. I made the text size smaller than the rest of the website and I also added padding so that there would be some space between the footer and the rest of the body text.
- **JavaScript**: I tried to add a confirmation window when the link to the game is clicked so that it would ask if you wanted to be redirected, but I could not figure it out. Instead I added an alert for when you enter the website to say hello and explain the link.
- **Other Semantic HTML Tags Added**: img, section, article, link, footer
    - img: I added an image to my website.
    - section: I divided my website into sections.
    - article: I titled the first introduction of my website an article because it could be a standalone paragraph.
    - link/footer: I added a link to a game I enjoy playing in the footer.

## Design Achievements
- **Used the Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts**: I used Libre Baskerville as the font for the primary text in my website. I went to Google Fonts and found a font I wanted to use. Then I linked the font stylesheet in the head element in my html file before adding the font as a rule for the body in my css file.
- **Used a Pastel Color Palette from Adobe**: I chose a light blue, light purple, and a yellow color for contrast. I wanted the color palette to be pastel, so I chose colors that were bright. I also limited the colors to three so that the website would not be too overwhelming with color. I used the blue as the website background, the purple as the color of the dividing line between the introduction and bulleted lists, and the yellow for the image border.
