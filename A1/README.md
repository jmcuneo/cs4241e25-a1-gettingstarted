## Technical Achievements
- Made use of CSS to modify the background colour, as well as the positioning of the text
  - Contains the following rules: body, h1, h2, p/li/ol/ul/summary, header, figure, .selfie, and .divider
  - Each block has comments within basic.css explaining what they are meant to do
- Modified server.js to not have hardcoded file names, only hardcoded file extensions.
- Added a viewport setting to the HTML, so that it renders better on my phone
- Managed to get the /Webware/A1 system working on the work subdomain
  - This was causing complications on my hosting provider due to it not pulling my Github submodule.
- Semantc HTML:
  - Uses links in the main page.
  - Uses a header block
  - Uses a figure
  - Uses details/summary to compress the experience section
- If you click on the figure, it does a little animation. I used [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/js-animation) for reference on how to do this.

## Design Achievements
- Utilized a font other than the default Arial (Franklin Gothic Medium)
  - Supposed to be accessibility friendly.
- Not entirely sure what the colour palette is supposed to be used for, but made use of my preferred grey colouring (light grey for the main background, and a darker shade for the header to provide contrast)
