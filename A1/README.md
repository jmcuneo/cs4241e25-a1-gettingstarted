## Technical Achievements
- Made use of CSS to modify the background colour, as well as the positioning of the text
  - This makes use of a body block, h1/h2 blocks, and a p/li/ol/ul block.
- Modified server.js to not have hardcoded file names, only hardcoded file extensions.
- Added a viewport setting to the HTML, so that it renders better on my phone
- Managed to get the /Webware/A1 system working on the work subdomain
  - This was causing complications on my hosting provider due to it not pulling my Github submodule.
- Uses links in the main page.
- Uses a header block
- Uses a figure
- If you click on the figure, it does a little animation. I used [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/js-animation) for reference on how to do this.

## Design Achievements
- Utilized a font other than the default Arial (Franklin Gothic Medium)
  - Supposed to be accessibility friendly.
